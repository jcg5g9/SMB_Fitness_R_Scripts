# SMB_Fitness_R_Scripts
Exploring the effects of hybridization and introgression on longevity, age structure, and productivity in admixed streams of the Neosho Smallmouth Bass range

# Aim 1 - Sample Sizes
## File: SMB_Fitness_Sample_Size_Analysis.Rmd

Purpose: Here I am determining the my sample sizes and plotting them across different rivers, sexes, genetic ID, etc.

### Data used:
#### All working data

# Aim 2 - Tests for Sexual Dimorphism
## File: SMB_Fitness_Sex_Dimorphism.Rmd

Purpose: here I am running  linear models to determine whether covariation between various morphometric traits (standard length, head length, orbital length, body depth) and total length is different between males and females. I want to determine whether males and females are growing differently in any of these traits, which addresses whether they may be sexual selection pressures affecting individual fitness

### Data used:
#### All working data

# Aim 3 - Individual Growth
## File: SMB_Fitness_Growth.Rmd

Purpose: Here I am developing von Bertalanffy growth curves for the overall sample set and for three genetic groups (pure Northern, pure Neosho, and admixed) within my admixed populations. I am aiming to determine whether there are differences in growth rate between pure Northern, Neosho, or admixed individuals. 

### Data used:
#### All working data

# Aim 4 - Genotype Analysis
## File: SMB_Fitness_STRUCTURE.Rmd

Purpose: Here I am plotting results from the program STRUCTURE, which assesses genetic composition of individual fish based on genotypes from 14 microsatellite markers.

### Data use:
#### Genotype data for 117 individuals over 14 microsatellite loci
